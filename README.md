# Kanji-N5-learning-web-app
A web application designed to help you learn and practice Japanese Kanji at the N5 level. This app offers both multiple-choice quizzes and free-writing exercises, giving you a comprehensive approach to memorizing Kanji meanings and readings.


## Motivation
I couldn’t find an app that fit the style of Kanji learning I wanted—something with both multiple-choice and free-writing options. So, I decided to build my own tool to help others (and myself) learn N5-level Kanji more effectively.

## Features
Multiple-Choice Quizzes
Practice recognizing Kanji through quick, multiple-choice questions.

Free-Writing Exercises
Test your recall by manually inputting the Kanji, encouraging deeper memorization.

Meaning & Pronunciation
View the English meaning and On’yomi reading for each Kanji.
